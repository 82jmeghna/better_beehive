# Better Beehive Project

This is the repository for the Better Beehive Project, using Node.JS and React.JS

## Getting Started

To get setup, I recommend *forking* the repo and cloning your fork. From the root of the project, run ```yarn install```

You have two options for running the project.

The command ```npm run dev``` will run a webpack development server with hot reloading enabled. Any changes to client files will automatically hot reload,
making for a smooth development experience.

The command ```npm run start``` will minify and concatenate all javascript client files into /client/dist/js/bundle.js and run a production server on port 3000.
I don't recommend this, except as a final check to make sure your code will still work in production.

## CONTRIBUTING

I recommend using branches on your fork to separate issues you might be working on, so that each PR can be focused on a single issue.
When making a pull request, make sure you are up to date with the master branch by fetching the upstream and rebasing. Squash all of your work
on an issue in to a single commit for your PR. If I make requests for you to modify your PR, make the changes and squash the commits again.
